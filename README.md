# Oral-Exam-Frontend
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to offer an alternative to traditional quiz-taking. One drawback of the way written exams are often setup in schools, is that they drastically disadvantage dyslexic students. Language classes are also often disadvantaged by written exams, because such a form of testing only rewards good writing skills and memorization of grammar. Finally, the biggest issues with written exams is cheating. Due to the emergence of AI, cheating has become a more imminent threat to the integrity of the academic system. Oral exams solve all of these problems. They test pronounciation and quick thinking, and real-time testing while being recorded makes more difficutlt to cheat. The main problem of oral-exams, however, is their immense time-consumption. Especially when they are not offered exclusively, but rather an extra option. Our project aims to solve this issue. Students will be quizzed in realtime by an AI-Agent on quizzes that teachers can create/assign on the site. The recordings and anti-cheat measures are then sent to multiple AIs that analyze these files and output a grade. This all occurs in a fraction of the time it would require a teacher to test each student and grade individually. <p>
